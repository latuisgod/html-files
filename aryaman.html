    <h1><B>PERSONAL LIFE</B></h1>

    <I>Marzia and Felix began dating in August 19th 2011, and started to make it public around October of 2011. She learned of him when her best friend watched PewDiePie on YouTube at the end of May and shared the videos with her. Marzia found Felix really funny and wrote to him at the end of June. He responded back and they started communicating for a while on Facebook until Felix visited her in Italy in August, and then in September as well as October. After Marzia's birthday, she moved to Sweden to live with him.

      On March 28th, 2012, Felix did his first newspaper interview with the Swedish site Expressen.se, in which he noted his intention to have a full-time job and while making YouTube videos as a secondary job as well as moving to Italy with Marzia.[citation needed]
      
      While still living in Sweden, Felix and Marzia went overseas to Los Angeles for the first time.[1]
      
      Following Felix's move to San Paolo, Italy, he stayed as a guest in Marzia's parents' house.
      
      On November 30th, 2012, he noted in a video of going aboard to Brighton with Marzia from December 3rd to December 7th.[2] On February 7th, 2013, they arrived in New York City after Marzia received an invitation to Fashion Week and met up to hang out with fellow YouTubers Anthony Padilla and Kalel.[3] The four of them went to the Museum of Modern Art, saw the movie "Mama" and played at the arcade.[4]
      
      Felix announced in an impromptu video monologue on March 11th, 2013 of saddening news about the death of his grandfather, who suffered from prolonged skeletal cancer and was returning to Sweden for the funeral rites.[5] He also made mention of plans of going to Los Angeles at the end of March to stay for a month as well as searching along with Marzia for a permanent residence in the United Kingdom.[5]
      
      While in Los Angeles, Felix participated in being part of a few video projects on the YouTube channel TheFineBros and was in an episode of Internet Icon. A party was hosted by Felix in Los Angeles to celebrate the growth of his channel to 6,000,000 subscribers and invited anyone interested in attending.[6] The party was on April 4th, 2013 with some guests in attendance that included YouTubers Ken[7], TJ[7], Toby Turner[7] and Olga Ray[7], Chester See[8], Davey Wavey[8] Tayrn Southern[8], Seth Hendrix[8], and Jacksfilms[8].
      
      Felix was nominated in the category of social media for the Social Star Awards 2013. As the live ceremony would take place on May 23rd, 2013 at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, he and Marzia took the opportunity to go.[9] He won and received the Social Media Show Award.
      
      For the summer of 2013, he and Marzia left Italy to stay in the United Kingdom for 3 months. Felix cited reasons behind the move; such as the necessity for personal space (as both himself and Marzia have been staying in the home of her parents in Italy) and also slow internet was interfering with the upload rate of his YouTube videos.[10]
      
      In late 2013, Felix was filmed for a part in YouTube Rewind: What Does 2013 Say?, along with fellow YouTubers Tobuscus, Ian and Anthony, Jenna Marbles, iJustine, and many others in California; however Pewds himself was filmed by a skeleton crew in Brighton, and thus was not present for the actual filming. In an interview, Nate Houghteling, one of the people from Portal A, the company responsible for producing the video, said that PewDiePie was actually kind of a last-minute addition to the video.
      
      As of April of 2018, he and Marzia are engaged.
      
      On August 20th, 2019, he and Marzia got married. Roomie, Dave, Jacksepticeye, JaidenAnimations, KickthepJ, CinnamonToastKen also attended the wedding.</I>

              <HR>
                In January 2018, when the channel of the Indian record label and film production company T-Series became the second most subscribed YouTube channel with over 30 million subscribers; T-Series was growing much more quickly than PewDiePie. It took until August 29, 2018, for PewDiePie to heed this warning—he declared war on T-Series; thus,<BR> the Great Subscriber War started.<BR> PewDiePie ended the war on April 28th, 2019,<BR> deciding it had gone too far after a mass murder occurred in his name.

                    <h2><B>MR.BEAST</B></h2>

                    ><I>YouTube star MrBeast recently launched a campaign to raise $20 million to plant trees in honor of reaching 20 million subscribers on the video-sharing platform.
                      MrBeast, aka Jimmy Donaldson, was one of the most-viewed YouTubers in 2019, thanks to attention-grabbing stunts in which he often puts in hours of work and donates thousands of dollars.
                      MrBeast actually got his start on YouTube at age 13 with video-game walkthroughs, but it took him years before he started to gain notoriety and find content that viewers wanted to watch.
                      Here's how the 21-year-old YouTuber got his start in online video, and how he's able to give away millions of dollars to friends, unsuspecting streamers across the internet, and random strangers.
                      MrBeast was one of the most-viewed creators on YouTube in 2019. With 27 million subscribers, it's hard to believe the YouTuber is only 21 MrBeast was born on May 7, 1998 as Jimmy Donaldson.
                       He grew up in eastern North Carolina in the city of Greenville, and graduated from a private high school there in 2016.However, he was only 13 years old when he uploaded his first video
                        to YouTube back in February 2012 under the username "MrBeast6000." For the first few years, MrBeast attempted, unsuccessfully, to master the YouTube algorithm by creating the content he thought 
                        would attract the biggest audience. "If it gets the most views, it's because people click on it and I want to give them what they want," MrBeast later said.As MrBeast attempted to game YouTube's algorithm,
                         the aspiring YouTuber went through stages of trends on his channel: funny compilations of highlights in playing "Minecraft" and "Call of Duty," estimating YouTubers' wealth, offering tips and tricks to 
                         aspiring creators, and commentating on YouTuber drama. MrBeast himself made very few appearances in his videos in the early days.MrBeast started to gain a following in 2015 and 2016 thanks to his "worst intros" 
                         series of videos, which rounded up and poked fun at YouTuber introductions he discovered on the platform. By mid-2016, MrBeast hit 30,000 subscribers.In late 2016, MrBeast enrolled in college, although the details
                          of his higher education are hard to come by. The YouTuber later said he lasted only two weeks in college before he dropped out, telling his mom: "I'd rather be poor than do anything beside YouTube." His mom made him 
                          move out of his North Carolina childhood at 18 "because she loves me and just wanted me to be successful," MrBeast wrote on Twitter in November 2019.MrBeast first went viral in January 2017, when he uploaded a video showing
                           himself counting to 100,000 — which he later revealed took him 44 hours. "I just really wanted it," MrBeast later said about the challenge. "I had dropped out of college, I wasn't really making much. I knew it would go viral.
                           "After that first video went viral, MrBeast found what the YouTube algorithm liked. He quickly amassed more views with similar stunts like spinning a fidget spinner for 24 hours and watching Jake Paul's "It's Everyday Bro" music
                            video for 10 hours straight. By November 2017, MrBeast reached 1 million subscribers.MrBeast now has a few types of videos that serve as his bread-and-butter on his channel. He still puts on exhausting, hours-long stunts — which
                             have been referred to as "junklord YouTube" — as well as last-person-to-leave challenges in which he gives out thousands of dollars. These videos' titles range from "Going Through the Same Drive Thru 1,000 Times" to "Last To Remove Hand, 
                             Gets Lamborghini Challenge."MrBeast also puts on attention-grabbing donation and charity stunts. He once opened up a car dealership where he gave out cars for free, and is known to dole out thousands of dollars to small streamers on Twitch and YouTube, 
                             as well as to waitresses and Uber drivers in person.As MrBeast has grown his channel, he was able to hire four of his childhood friends — Chris, Chandler, Garret, and Jake — to work for him and his YouTube channel. The group often makes cameos in some
                              of MrBeast's wildest last-person-to-leave challenges, and have become iconic names in the MrBeast empire.By December 2018, MrBeast had given out $1 million through his outlandish stunts, earning him the title of "YouTube's biggest philanthropist.
                              " MrBeast is a product of his own viral content: He's only able to give out these thousands of dollars thanks to six-figure brand deals to fund in-video ads.MrBeast has been credited with helping to launch a new style of expensive stunt videos on YouTube
                               in which creators pull off elaborate challenges and large-scale sponsored giveaways.
